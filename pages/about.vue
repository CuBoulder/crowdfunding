        CU Boulder Crowdfunding is a campus online fundraising platform that enables the CU Boulder community to build connections, identify resources and create a lasting impact. In our partnership with University students, faculty and staff, we develop and share fundraising campaigns with an engaged audience.
        Be involved as a campaign contributor -- donate to any active CU Boulder crowdfunding campaign, supporting University members in their work as leaders, dedication to innovation and continuous efforts to positively impact humanity. 
        Be involved as a campaign creator -- current CU Boulder students, faculty and staff are invited to apply to use the crowdfunding platform as a place for online fundraising. A campaign creator’s work is directly related to the University’s mission in shaping tomorrow’s leaders, striving to be the top University for innovation and positively impacting humanity. 
        We are working to refine and expand CU Boulder Crowdfunding, so we welcome any feedback that can help us improve the platform.
